# TRY YOUR LUCK! PLAY BLACKJACK!


## OVERVIEW
The objective of this assignment was to code a game of blackjack for any number of players. The basic logic is that to reach near the number 21 as soon as possible by creating the sum of it. It is a user interactive game. 
At first all the players are given 2 cards each and they can look at it. Dealer also gets 2 cards, but he/she can only see onecard out of two. 
So, the player 1 adds his/her total and if its lesser than 21 it decides to hit or stand. If its choice is to stand then thedealer moves on to player2.
It goes on till it reaches the dealer. Dealer now sees his 2nd card and if its sum is greater than all the players then the dealer wins, otherwise he loses.
While this game is going on, they can put bets if they are confident with their cards.
If a player wins, the dealer and the other players give him money or his money is raised by 1.5.
If dealer wins, the players give the money to the dealer .
If the a player has 2 same cards then then it can split and plays with two hands.
The face cards attains the value of 10 and the ace cards can attain the value of 1 or 11 depending on the situation.

1) Initially you need to input the number of players and then their betting money.

3) The code is written with comments and proper print comments for the ease of user.
4) ENJOY!
